        the CLFS System Bootable
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your shiny new CLFS system is almost complete. One of the last things
        to do is to ensure that the system can be properly booted. The
        instructions below apply only to NewWorld Macintoshes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boot loading can be a complex area, so a few cautionary words are in
        order. Be familiar with the current boot loader and any other
        operating systems present on the hard drive(s) that need to be
        bootable. Make sure that an emergency CD is ready to
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">rescue</span>&rdquo; the computer if it
        becomes un-bootable. It is also a good idea to enable booting from
        Open Firmware in case things go really wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier, we compiled and installed the yaboot boot loader software in
        preparation for this step. The procedure involves writing the
        bootloader to a bootstrap partition and blessing it so that Open
        Firmware will boot from it. This is all handled by <span class=
        "command"><strong>ybin</strong></span>, the yaboot installer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ybin writes an optional 'OS selector' menu into Open Firmware, then
        writes yaboot and <code class="filename">yaboot.conf</code> to the
        bootstrap partition, blesses this, and updates the boot device
        recorded in nvram. When booted, the OF provides the initial menu to
        choose between linux, boot from CD, and e.g. OSX (depending on what
        was in <code class="filename">yaboot.conf</code>). If you boot to
        'linux', yaboot is executed and lets you select which kernel to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images (kernels) are specified, together with any necessary path, in
        <code class="filename">yaboot.conf</code> - the details are
        incorporated into the bootloader, but no attempt is made to access or
        validate the paths until they are selected. There are many possible
        options that can be specified in <code class=
        "filename">yaboot.conf</code>, see the man page for the details. Most
        people will be able to specify device=hd: (for a single hard disk),
        but if you have multiple disks, or if you wish to be pedantic, you
        can specify the full OF path to the device, obtained by running
        <span class="command"><strong>ofpath /dev/hdX</strong></span> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the above information, determine the appropriate designators
        for the bootstrap partition and the root partition. For the following
        example, it is assumed that the bootstrap partition is <code class=
        "filename">hda2</code> and the root partition is <code class=
        "filename">hda7</code>. We will also assume that you wish to be able
        to boot an OSX installation on <code class="filename">hda4</code>.
        Change these items as necessary for your machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your machine has a SATA disk, specify the partitions using
        <code class="filename">/dev/sda7</code> and so forth in the usual
        way. At least some of the distros specify a full OF path to the
        'device' and to the image(s), such as <em class=
        "parameter"><code>device=/ht@0,f2000000/pci@3/k2-sata-root@c/k2-sata@0/disk@0:</code></em>
        for the disk, and <em class=
        "parameter"><code>image=/ht@0,f2000000/pci@3/k2-sata-root@c/k2-sata@0/disk@0:9,/boot/clfskernel-4.9.21</code></em>
        which definitely works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a &ldquo;<span class="quote">yaboot.conf</span>&rdquo; file
        defining yaboot's boot menu:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt; /etc/yaboot.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal"># Begin /etc/yaboot.conf

# By default, yaboot will boot the first menu entry.

# Allow 10 seconds before booting the default.
# this will also apply to the first-stage os selector
timeout=100

# These variables are global
# first, where to put the bootstrap partition
boot=/dev/hda2

# Which disk to use
device=hd:

# Default partition for the kernel images
partition=7

# default root partition
root=/dev/hda7

# where ybin is to find yaboot and ofboot
install=/usr/lib/yaboot/yaboot
magicboot=/usr/lib/yaboot/ofboot

# allow the initial menu to offer CD as an option
enablecdboot

# allow the initial menu to offer booting from Open Firmware
enableofboot

# allow the initial menu to boot from mac osx
macosx=/dev/hda4

# white on black is boring!
# note  the spellings : 'fgcolor' but 'light'
# in this context, light means 'without high intensity'
fgcolor=light-green

# The first entry is for CLFS.
# For all images, the pathname is relative to the filesystem
# on which they are situated and can include at most one
# directory
image=/boot/clfskernel-4.9.21
    label=GIT-20170803
    read-only</code>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Add an entry for the host distribution, if you have one. It might
        look something like this if the kernel and initrd are in the host's
        '/' directory on <code class="filename">hda6</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">cat &gt;&gt; /etc/yaboot.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal">title Debian
image=/pci@f4000000/ata-6d/disk@0:6,/vmlinux
    label=Debian
    initrd=/pci@f4000000/ata-6d/disk@0:6,/initrd.gz
    initrd-size=10000
    append="root=/dev/hda7"
    read-only</code>
EOF</kbd></pre>
      <div class="admon warning">
        <img alt="[Warning]" src="../images/warning.png" />
        <h3>
          Warning

        <p>
          The following command will update the bootstrap partition and the
          boot variable in Open Firmware. Do not run the command if this is
          not desired.
        </p>
      </div>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">ybin</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Alternatively, if the bootstrap partition has not already been
        initialized, perhaps because you are using a Live CD, you will need
        to use a different command to install the bootloader for the first
        time:
      </p>
