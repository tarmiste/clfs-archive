      <p>
        Thank you for reading this CLFS book. We hope that you have found
        this book helpful and have learned more about the system creation
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the CLFS system is installed, you may be wondering
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">What next?</span>&rdquo; To answer that
        question, we have compiled a list of resources for you.
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">

            </p>
            <p>
              Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all
              software. Since a CLFS system is compiled from source, it is up
              to you to keep abreast of such reports. There are several
              online resources that track such reports, some of which are
              shown below:

            <p>
              The Community Driven Beyond Linux From Scratch wiki covers
              installation procedures for a wide range of software beyond the
              scope of the CLFS Book. CBLFS is designed specifically to work
              with the CLFS book, and has all the necessary information to
              continue the builds in the same manner that CLFS uses. This is
              a community driven project, which means anyone can contribute
              and provide updates. The CBLFS project is located at <a class=
