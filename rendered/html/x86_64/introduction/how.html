        System
      </h1>
      <p>
        The CLFS system will be built by using a previously installed Unix
        system or Linux distribution (such as Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, or
        Ubuntu). This existing system (the host) will be used as a starting
        point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker,
        and shell, to build the new system. Select the &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">development</span>&rdquo; option during the distribution
        installation to be able to access these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an alternative to installing an entire separate distribution onto
        your machine, you may wish to use a livecd. Most distributions
        provide a livecd, which provides an environment to which you can add
        the required tools onto, allowing you to successfully follow the
        instructions in this book. Remember that if you reboot the livecd you
        will need to reconfigure the host environment before continuing with
        your build.

        "Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Preparing a New Partition">Preparing a New
        Partition</a> of this book describes how to create a new Linux native
        partition and file system, the place where the new CLFS system will
        be compiled and installed. <a class="xref" href=

        explains which packages and patches need to be downloaded to build a
        CLFS system and how to store them on the new file system. <a class=

        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Final Preparations">Final Preparations</a>
        discusses the setup for an appropriate working environment. Please

        carefully as it explains several important issues the developer
        should be aware of before beginning to work through <a class="xref"
        href="../cross-tools/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing Cross-Compile Tools">Constructing
        Cross-Compile Tools</a> and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../cross-tools/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing Cross-Compile Tools">Constructing
        Cross-Compile Tools</a> explains the installation of cross-compile
        tools which will be built on the host but be able to compile programs
        that run on the target machine. These cross-compile tools will be
        used to create a temporary, minimal system that will be the basis for
        building the final CLFS system. Some of these packages are needed to
        resolve circular dependencies&mdash;for example, to compile a
        compiler, you need a compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of building cross-compile tools first involves building
        and installing all the necessary tools to create a build system for
        the target machine. With these cross-compiled tools, we eliminate any
        dependencies on the toolchain from our host distro.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we build our &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">Cross-Tools</span>&rdquo;, we start building a very minimal
        working system in <code class="filename">/tools</code>, using the
        cross-toolchain in <code class="filename">/cross-tools</code>. Once
        the temporary system is finished, we perform a few additional tasks
        to prepare to enter this temporary build environment, either by
        booting or chrooting into it. For more details about the difference
        between these methods, see <a class="xref" href=
        "../temp-system/choose.html" title=
        "6.30.&nbsp;To Boot or to Chroot?">Section&nbsp;6.30, &ldquo;To Boot
        or to Chroot?&rdquo;</a>.
      </p>

        In <a class="xref" href="../final-system/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Installing
        Basic System Software</a>, after having booted or chrooted into the
        temporary build environment, the full CLFS system is built.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the installation, several configuration files are created
        in <a class="xref" href="../system-config/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;11.&nbsp;System Configuration">System

        End</a> contains information on furthering the CLFS experience beyond
        this book. After the steps in this book have been implemented, the
        computer will be ready to reboot into the new CLFS system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each step
        is discussed in the following chapters and package descriptions.
        Items that may seem complicated will be clarified, and everything
        will fall into place as the reader embarks on the CLFS adventure.
