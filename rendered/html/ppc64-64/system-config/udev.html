            11.5.1.1. Static Device Nodes
          </h3>
          <p>
            Linux systems in general traditionally use a static device
            creation method, whereby a great many device nodes are created
            under <code class="filename">/dev</code> (sometimes literally
            thousands of nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding
            hardware devices actually exist. This is typically done via a
            <span class="command"><strong>MAKEDEV</strong></span> script,
            which contains a number of calls to the <span class=
            "command"><strong>mknod</strong></span> program with the relevant
            major and minor device numbers for every possible device that
            might exist in the world.

            11.5.1.2. Devfs
          </h3>
          <p>
            In February 2000, a new filesystem called <code class=
            "systemitem">devfs</code>, which dynamically created device nodes
            as devices were found by the kernel, was merged into the 2.3.46
            kernel and was made available during the 2.4 series of stable
            kernels. Although it was present in the kernel source itself,
            this method of creating devices dynamically never received
            overwhelming support from the core kernel developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main problem with the approach adopted by <code class=
            "systemitem">devfs</code> was the way it handled device
            detection, creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device
            node naming, was perhaps the most critical. It is generally
            accepted that if device names are allowed to be configurable,
            then the device naming policy should be up to a system
            administrator, not imposed on them by any particular
            developer(s). The <code class="systemitem">devfs</code> file
            system also suffered from race conditions that were inherent in
            its design and could not be fixed without a substantial revision
            to the kernel. It was marked deprecated with the release of the
            2.6 kernel series, and was removed entirely as of version 2.6.18.

            11.5.1.3. Sysfs
          </h3>
          <p>
            With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later
            released as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual
            filesystem called <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> came to
            be. The job of <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> is to export
            a view of the system's hardware configuration to userspace
            processes. Drivers that have been compiled into the kernel
            directly register their objects with <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code> as they are detected by the kernel. For
            drivers compiled as modules, this registration will happen when
            the module is loaded. Once the <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code> filesystem is mounted (on <code class=
            "filename">/sys</code>), data which the built-in drivers
            registered with <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> are
            available to userspace processes. With this userspace-visible
            representation, the possibility of seeing a userspace replacement
            for <code class="systemitem">devfs</code> became much more
            realistic.

            11.5.1.4. Udev Implementation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Shortly after the introduction of <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>, work began on a program called Udev to
            advantage of it. The <span class=
            "command"><strong>udev</strong></span> daemon made calls to
            <code class="function">mknod()</code> to create device nodes in
            <code class="filename">/dev</code> dynamically, based on the
            information from <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>, in
            <code class="filename">/sys</code>. For example, <code class=
            "filename">/sys/class/tty/vcs/dev</code> contains the string
            &ldquo;<span class="quote">7:0</span>&rdquo;. This string was
            used by <span class="command"><strong>udev</strong></span> to
            create a device node with major number <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>7</em></span> and minor number <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>0</em></span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linux kernel version 2.6.32 introduced a new virtual file system
            called <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code>, an improved
            replacement for <code class="systemitem">devfs</code>. This
            allows device nodes to once again be dynamically created by the
            kernel, without many of the problems of <code class=
            "systemitem">devfs</code>. As of version 176, Udev no longer
            creates device nodes itself, instead relying on <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> to do so.

            In 2010, development began on systemd, an alternate <span class=

            with Udev 183, Udev's source tree was merged with systemd.
            Several Gentoo developers who disagreed with this merge announced
            a project fork called Eudev in December 2012, created by
            extracting the Udev code from systemd. One of the goals of Eudev
            is to allow for easier installation and usage of <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> without the need for the
            rest of systemd.

        <p>
          By default, device nodes created by the kernel in a <code class=
          "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> are owned by <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>root:root</em></span> and have <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>600</em></span> permissions. <span class=
          "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> can modify ownership and
          permissions of the nodes under the <code class=
          "filename">/dev</code> directory, and can also create additional
          symlinks, based on rules specified in the files within the
          <code class="filename">/etc/udev/rules.d</code>, <code class=
          "filename">/lib/udev/rules.d</code>, and <code class=
          "filename">/run/udev/rules.d</code> directories. The names for
          these files start with a number, to indicate the order in which
          they are run, and they have a <code class="filename">.rules</code>
          extension (<span class="command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will
          ignore files with any other extension). All of the rules files from
          these directories are combined into a single list, sorted by
          filename, and run in that order. In the event of a conflict, where
          a rules file with the same name exists in two or more of these
          directories, the rules in <code class="filename">/etc</code> take
          the highest priority, followed by rules files in <code class=

          defined by the kernel, as described above. For more details about

          11.5.3. Module Loading
        </h2>
        <p>
          Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into
          them. Aliases are visible in the output of the <span class=
          "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> program and are usually
          related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices supported by a
          module. For example, the <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span> driver supports PCI devices
          with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of
          &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</span>&rdquo;. For
          most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver that
          would handle the device via <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>.
          E.g., the <code class=
          "filename">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</code> file
          might contain the string &ldquo;<span class=
          "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</span>&rdquo;.
          The default rules provided by Udev will cause <span class=
          "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> to call out to <span class=
          "command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe</strong></span> with the contents
          of the <code class="envar">MODALIAS</code> uevent environment
          variable (that should be the same as the contents of the
          <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in sysfs), thus loading
          all modules whose aliases match this string after wildcard
          expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this example, this means that, in addition to <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
          <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> driver will be loaded
          if it is available. See below for ways in which the loading of
          unwanted drivers can be prevented.

          11.5.4. Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically
          creating device nodes.
        </p>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            11.5.4.1. A kernel module is not loaded automatically
          </h3>
          <p>
            Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and
            the bus driver properly exports the necessary aliases to
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>. In other cases, one should
            arrange module loading by other means. With Linux-4.9.21, Udev is
            known to load properly-written drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB,
            SCSI, SERIO and FireWire devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary
            support for Udev, run <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> with the module name as
            the argument. Now try locating the device directory under
            <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code> and check whether there is
            a <code class="filename">modalias</code> file there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file exists in
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>, the driver supports the
            device and can talk to it directly, but doesn't have the alias,
            it is a bug in the driver. Load the driver without the help from
            Udev and expect the issue to be fixed later.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is no <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in the
            relevant directory under <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code>,
            this means that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias
            support to this bus type. With Linux-4.9.21, this is the case
            with ISA busses. Expect this issue to be fixed in later kernel
            versions.

            only enhances the functionality provided by some other module
            (e.g., <span class="emphasis"><em>snd-pcm-oss</em></span>
            enhances the functionality of <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-pcm</em></span> by making the sound cards
            available to OSS applications), configure <span class=
            "command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> to load the wrapper
            after Udev loads the wrapped module. To do this, add an
            &ldquo;<span class="quote">install</span>&rdquo; line to a file
            in <code class="filename">/etc/modprobe.d</code>. For example:

            If the module in question is not a wrapper and is useful by
            itself, configure the <span class=
            "command"><strong>S05modules</strong></span> bootscript to load
            this module on system boot. To do this, add the module name to
            the <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/modules</code> file on
            a separate line. This works for wrapper modules too, but is
            suboptimal in that case.

            11.5.4.5. Udev rule works unreliably
          </h3>
          <p>
            This may be another manifestation of the previous problem. If
            not, and your rule uses <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            attributes, it may be a kernel timing issue, to be fixed in later
            kernels. For now, you can work around it by creating a rule that
            waits for the used <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            attribute and appending it to the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d/10-wait_for_sysfs.rules</code> file.
            Please notify the CLFS Development list if you do so and it
            helps.

            11.5.4.6. Device naming order changes randomly after rebooting
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is due to the fact that Udev, by design, handles uevents and
            loads modules in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order.
            This will never be &ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">fixed</span>&rdquo;. You should not rely upon the kernel
            device names being stable. Instead, create your own rules that
            make symlinks with stable names based on some stable attributes
            of the device, such as a serial number or the output of various
            *_id utilities installed by Udev. See <a class="xref" href=
