        Rationale
      </h1>
      <p>
        CLFS includes many packages, a number of which might not necessarily
        be required for a "minimal" system, but still considered very useful.
        The purpose of this page is to list the reasoning for each package's
        inclusion in the book.
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Acl
            </p>
            <p>
              The Acl package allows usage and setting of POSIX Access
              Control Lists. It can be used by several other packages in
              CLFS, such as Coreutils and Systemd.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Attr
            </p>
            <p>
              Attr allows setting and viewing extended attributes of
              filesystem objects. It is required by Systemd.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Autoconf
            </p>
            <p>
              The Autoconf package contains programs for producing shell
              scripts that can automatically configure source code. This is
              useful for software developers, as well as anyone who wants to
              install packages that don't come with a configure script, such
              as some of the packages in CBLFS.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Automake
            </p>
            <p>
              The Automake package contains programs for generating Makefiles
              for use with Autoconf. This can be useful to software
              developers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bash
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains the Bourne-Again SHell. A shell is an
              important component of a Linux system, as there must be some
              way of allowing the users to enter commands.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bc
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains a precision calculator. The Linux kernel
              uses Bc to render the timeconst header.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Binutils
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains programs for handling object files. The
              programs in this package are needed for compiling most of the
              packages in CLFS.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bison
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains programs that are required by several
              packages in CLFS.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

              Bzip2
            </p>
            <p>
              The programs in this package are useful for compressing files
              to reduce size. They are also needed to uncompress tarballs for
              many CLFS packages.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              CLFS-Boot-scripts
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains a number of scripts that run at boottime,
              performing essential tasks such as mounting/checking
              filesystems and starting the network interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              This package contains a test harness for other programs. It is
              used for some packages' test suites.

            <p>
              Coreutils
            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains many basic command-line file-management
              tools, required for installation of every package in CLFS.
            </p>

            <p>
              D-Bus
            </p>
            <p>
              D-Bus is a message bus system, which allows applications to
              communicate to each other. It is used by Systemd.

              DejaGNU
            </p>
            <p>
              This package is needed for the test suites of several packages,
              especially GCC and Binutils.
            </p>

              DHCPCD
            </p>
            <p>
              This package allows for automatic configuration of network
              interfaces from a DHCP server. It (or some other package
              providing a DHCP client is needed to connect to a DHCP server.

            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains programs to compare files, and can also
              be used to create patches. It is required by the installation
              procedures of many CLFS packages, and used by many packages'
              test suites.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              Eudev
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a package that allows for dynamic creation of device
              nodes. It is a fork of Udev, which is now part of Systemd. It
              is still used for the "Boot" method in the temp-system, as
              Systemd is not needed there.
            </p>
          </li>

            </p>
            <p>
              This package contains programs for finding files based on
              certain criteria, and optionally performing commands on them.
              These programs are used by the installation procedures of many
              CLFS packages.
