        To Boot or to Chroot?
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are two different ways you can proceed from this point to build
        the final system. You can build a kernel, a bootloader, and a few
        other utilities, boot into the temporary system, and build the rest
        there. Alternatively, you can mount a few virtual filesystems and
        chroot into the temporary system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <span class="command"><strong>chroot</strong></span> (change
        root) program is used to enter a virtual environment and start a new
        shell whose root directory will be set to the CLFS partition. This is
        very similar to rebooting and instructing the kernel to mount the
        CLFS partition as the root partition. The major advantage is that
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">chrooting</span>&rdquo; allows the builder
        to continue using the host while CLFS is being built. While waiting
        for package compilation to complete, a user can switch to a different
        virtual console (VC) or X desktop and continue using the computer as
        normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main downside to chrooting is that you are more limited in when
        you can use it - booting will always work for any CLFS build, but the
        chroot method can only be used when you are building on the same
        architecture. For example, if you are building on, and for, an x86
        system, you can simply chroot. Booting is required when you are
        compiling for a different architecture, such as building a PowerPC
        system from an x86. The rule of thumb here is that if the
        architectures match and you are running the same series kernel
        (specifically, a 3.12.0 or newer Linux kernel) you can just chroot.
        If you aren't running the same series kernel, or are wanting to run a
        different ABI, you will need to use the boot option.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powerpc64 is slightly different from some of the other architectures,
        because a 64-bit kernel running 32-bit userspace can successfully
        chroot and execute 64-bit programs. However, if the kernel
        personality has been set to 32-bit by a utility such as linux32, it
        will eventually fail when Glibc thinks it is building on a 32-bit
        system and tries to include incompatible assembler code in the 64-bit
        glibc.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see if you can successfully chroot to build the final powerpc64
        system, enter the following command which tests if you are running a
        64-bit Linux 2.6 kernel (with a 64-bit personality):
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">uname -a | grep '^Linux.*2\.6\..*ppc64' &amp;&amp; \
    echo "ok to chroot" || echo "you must boot"</kbd></pre>
