      </h1>
      <p>
        This appendix documents some of the features of ppc macintoshes, and
        in particular the requirements of coexisting with Mac OS's (OSX or
        the old OS9). It is only relevant to NewWorld hardware.

              The Open Firmware (OF) is the code in ROM or nvram which
              controls how the machine boots. If booting automatically, it
              will boot from the first valid blessed partition it finds (this
              is a simplification, but it is adequate for normal purposes).
            </p>
            <p>
              It can only read apple filesystems (hfs, hfs+, or hfsx
              depending on the version of the firmware). For disks under
              linux, the blessing is done by ybin when it installs yaboot
              (the loader) and yaboot.conf.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mac OS's have a tendency to look at other hfs{,+,x} filesystems
              on the disk, and unbless them if they do not match their
              expectations. Unblessing makes them unbootable. Fortunately, a
              filesystem of type <code class="literal">Apple_Bootstrap</code>
              can be read as hfs by the OF, but will be ignored by Mac OS.

            <p>
              Macintoshes use their own partition format - this means that
              other machines are unlikely to be able to read or write to
              macintosh partitions (in particular, fdisk does not understand
              them). The format allows a large number of individual
              partitions, and the native Mac tools had a tendency to insert
              small "filler" partitions between the real partitions. Under
              linux, using more than 15 partitions can be problematic
              (shortage of device nodes), so the normal approach is to use
              the Mac tools to create an area of freespace at the
              <span class="emphasis"><em>front</em></span> of the disk, then
              put the Mac OS partition(s) after it and (re-)install the Mac
              OS. The freespace can then be partitioned using <span class=
              "command"><strong>parted</strong></span> or the older
              <span class="command"><strong>mac-fdisk</strong></span>. It
              seems that recent versions of the Mac tools may no longer
              insert the filler partitions, so it may be possible to do all
              the partitioning before installing OSX.
            </p>

                Warning
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Macintosh resizing and partitioning tools are destructive
                and may delete all data when a partition is resized, even on
                unaltered partitions.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              For the Linux partitions, you will need a bootstrap partition -
              this can normally be a mere 800KB in size (the smallest hfs
              partition available) although the Fedora installer has been
              known to insist on 800MB. This has to be in front of the Mac OS
              partition. The bootstrap is <span class=
              "emphasis"><em>never</em></span> mounted as a regular partition
              and should not be confused with a <code class=
              "literal">/boot</code> partition. Other partitions are as
              normal (at least one rootfs, perhaps swap, perhaps others).
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the lfs-from-osx hint, the Mac partitioning tools
              can create an apple_bootstrap partition and therefore there is
              no need to use a Linux CD to create the desired partitions from
              freespace, but using a Linux CD to create the partitions is a
              more widely tested approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you follow this approach, partition 1 will be the apple
              partition map, partition 2 will be the bootstrap at the start
              of the disk, the linux partitions will follow, and then the mac
              partition(s) - under OSX the first mac partition will be number
              3, under OS9 it would have a higher number and there would be
              some apple driver partitions.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>OSX or OF
            upgrades</strong></span></span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              If the machine is dual-booted with OSX, the mac kernel or the
              OF will probably be upgraded at some point. This appears to
              either unbless the bootstrap, or else just point the OF boot
              device to the mac partition - so, the linux system will no
              longer be bootable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, you will need to know which partition contains the
              bootstrap so that you can boot it from OF (on an apple
              keyboard, hold down option-command-o-f (that is, alt-apple-o-f)
              while booting then enter a command like:
            </p>
            <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
            "command">boot hd:2,yaboot</kbd></pre>
            <p>
              This will allow you to select a linux boot, and from there you
              will have to rerun <span class=
              "command"><strong>ybin</strong></span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "OS chooser" menu that yaboot typically loads is stored in
              the OF and will not be available after a Mac kernel or firmware
              upgrade until <span class=
              "command"><strong>ybin</strong></span> has been rerun.
            </p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Yaboot's
            requirements</strong></span></span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              Yaboot is the boot loader for linux, sometimes referred to as
              the second stage loader. It reads the yaboot.conf file on the
              bootstrap partition to find which linux system(s) should be
              available, and attempts to load the required kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bootstrap man page warns that the path to the kernel should
              contain no more than one directory for reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yaboot has to be able to understand the filesystem, so that it
              can find the kernel. It understands hfs (not useful for linux,
              it is not case-sensitive), ext2 (and therefore it can read
              ext3), reiser3, and xfs. If you want to use a different type of
              filesystem for '/' you will have to create a separate boot
              partition with a supported filesystem, and use that to hold the
              kernels.
            </p>
          </dd>

            <span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Requirements if
            starting from OSX</strong></span></span>

          <dd>
            <p>
              Older versions of OSX (panther, leopard) can write to ext2
              filesystems using version 1.3 of ext2fsx. The upgrade to tiger
              broke this, and version 1.4 of ext2fsx only supports reading.
              Users of current OSX will therefore have to find some other way
              of creating a suitable filesystem and populating it, such as a
              Live CD or rescue CD.
