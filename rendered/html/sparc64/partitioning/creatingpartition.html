      </h1>
      <p>
        Like most other operating systems, CLFS is usually installed on a
        dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building a CLFS
        system is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough
        unpartitioned space, to create one. However, if you're building for a
        different architecture you can simply build everything in
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">/mnt/clfs</span>&rdquo; (or whatever
        directory you want to use) and transfer it to your target machine. If
        you do not plan to use a separate partition for building CLFS, you
        can skip the rest of this chapter and continue on to <a class="xref"
        href="../materials/chapter.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Packages and Patches">Packages and Patches</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minimal system requires around 6 gigabytes (GB). This is enough to
        store all the source tarballs and compile the packages. The CLFS
        system itself will not take up this much room. A large portion of
        this requirement is to provide sufficient free temporary storage.
        Compiling packages can require a lot of disk space which will be
        reclaimed after the package is installed. If the CLFS system is
        intended to be the primary Linux system, additional software will
        probably be installed which will require additional space (2-10 GB).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
        available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
        disk partition as swap space. This is used by the kernel to store
        seldom-used data and leave more memory available for active
        processes. The swap partition for a CLFS system can be the same as
        the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary to
        create another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the <code class="systemitem">root</code> user, start a disk
        partitioning program such as <span class=
        "command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> or <span class=
        "command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> with a command line option
        naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be
        created&mdash;for example <code class="filename">/dev/sda</code> for
        the primary Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) or Serial ATA (SATA)
        disk. Create a Linux native partition and a swap partition, if
        needed. Please refer to <code class="filename">cfdisk(8)</code> or
        <code class="filename">fdisk(8)</code> if you do not yet know how to
        use the programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <code class=
        "filename">sda5</code>). This book will refer to this as the CLFS
        partition. Also, remember the designation of the swap partition.
        These names will be needed later for the <code class=
        "filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a Sparc system we have to create a special partition first. This
        partition is called &ldquo;<span class="quote">Whole
        disk</span>&rdquo;, and must be the 3rd partition on the disk. The
        other partitions are virtual slices of this &ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">Whole disk</span>&rdquo; partition.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some limitations on the first partition of <code class=
        "filename">hda</code> or <code class="filename">sda</code> on the
        system. This partition must be less than 2 gigabytes, and it must be
        root.
