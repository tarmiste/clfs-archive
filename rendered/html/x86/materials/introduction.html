      </h1>
      <p>
        This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded
        for building a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers
        correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, and
        this book is based on their use. We highly recommend not using newer
        versions because the build commands for one version may not work with
        a newer version. The newest package versions may also have problems
        that require work-arounds. These work-arounds will be developed and
        stabilized in the development version of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
        location has changed since this book was published, Google (<a class=
        "ulink" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>)
        provides a useful search engine for most packages. If this search is
        unsuccessful, try one of the alternative means of downloading
        discussed at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://clfs.org/files/packages/git/">http://clfs.org/files/packages/git/</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a directory called <code class=
        "filename">${CLFS}/sources</code> and use it to store your sources
        and patches. All packages should be compiled there as well. Using any
        other location for compiling may have unexpected results.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this directory, execute, as user <code class=
        "systemitem">root</code>, the following command before starting the
        download session:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">mkdir -v ${CLFS}/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Make this directory writable and sticky. When a directory is marked
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">sticky</span>&rdquo;, that means that even
        if multiple users have write permission on that directory, any file
        within that directory can only be deleted or modified by its owner.
        The following command, run as <code class="systemitem">root</code>,
        will enable the write and sticky modes:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">chmod -v a+wt ${CLFS}/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        You can download all needed packages and patches into this directory
        either by using the links on the following pages in this section, or
        by passing the <a class="ulink" href="../dl.list">download list</a>
        to <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class=
      "command">wget -i dl.list -P ${CLFS}/sources</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Verification of downloaded packages can be done by downloading the
        following MD5 or SHA1 checksum lists:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://clfs.org/files/packages/git/MD5SUMS">MD5SUMS</a>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">pushd ${CLFS}/sources
md5sum -c MD5SUMS
popd</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://clfs.org/files/packages/git/SHA1SUMS">SHA1SUMS</a>:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">pushd ${CLFS}/sources
sha1sum -c SHA1SUMS
popd</kbd></pre>
