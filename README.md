# clfs-archive

Feb 2019

This repository is an archive of selected CLFS materials and is
intended for historical and reference purposes.   With the CLFS
project apparently winding down and it's future in an uncertain
state, it seemed prudent to make a copy of it and archive it here.

Said material is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## Repository contents

The material in this repository is not being actively developed 
but is simply a snapshot of certain CLFS materials (and other 
materials derived from CLFS materials).  In fact, certain problems
are known to exist in the materials in this repository but there
will be no changes made here to address them.   If changes or fixes
are made, those changes will be made in a seperate project.

The clfs-embedded and clfs-sysroot materials are not in this 
repository.  Just the main CLFS book and associated materials are
here.

This respository contains several items:

1) In the sub directory 'clfs' is a snapshot of the CLFS book taken
   from the clfs.org git repository.  It is only a snapshot of the
   current state of the CLFS book and does not contain the .git history
   from the CLFS server.

2) In the sub directory 'rendered' is the various CLFS books 
   rendered (from the snapshot) into human friendly format.

3) In the subdirectories 'oldpatches' and 'oldsources" are selected
   (mostly from older versions of CLFS) patches and source files that 
   may be useful.

   This repository does not contain all the sources required to build
   a CLFS system.  oldsources and oldpatches contain only certain
   files that may be difficult to obtain otherwise.

4) In the subdirectory 'jhalfs' are scripts created by jhalfs for 
   the various CLFS books in the snapshot.
